## JS introduction

> JS in multiparadigm language (functional + object oriented). Its not purely functional as in functional language we cann't do any kind of mutation whereas in jS we do it so its not fully functional.

> Javascript is an dynamically typed, single threaded, language which is used to give dynamic behaviour to static web pages.

> Javascript uses V8 engine at its core.

> Javascript uses JIT compilation. JIT is an combination of both compiler and interpreter.
