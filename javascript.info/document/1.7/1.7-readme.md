to insert an HTML string “as html”, with all tags and stuff working, in the same manner as elem.innerHTML we use below methods

elem.insertAdjacentHTML(where, html).

"beforebegin" – insert html immediately before elem,
"afterbegin" – insert html into elem, at the beginning,
"beforeend" – insert html into elem, at the end,
"afterend" – insert html immediately after elem.

To remove a node, there’s a method node.remove().

elem.cloneNode(true)

DocumentFragment is a special DOM node that serves as a wrapper to pass around lists of nodes.
