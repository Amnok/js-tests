-> functions are first class objects as they could normally be passed around and can be returned from a function.
-> callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions.
-> A function passe3d as an argument to another function is called an callback function.
-> A function that takes a functionas an argument or returns a function is called higher order function.
-> synchronous vs asynchronous callbacks

synchronous callbacks
-> map, filter
Asynchronous callbacks
