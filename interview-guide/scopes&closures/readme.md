scope
-> availability of variables in our code
-> scope dictates where the javascript engine should look for things

closures
->the combination of the function and its scope chain (lexical environment )
is what called a closure.

function currying
-> in this we transform a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of
nesting functions that take one argument at a time.
