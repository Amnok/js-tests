variable daclarations (let vs const vs var)

-> var declations are function scoped whereas let & const are block scoped.
-> only variable declarations are hoisted at the top not variable initializations.

-> let and const are hoisted but they are never initialized even with undefined

=> all const declarations mst be initialized and once initialized you cannot reassign them.
