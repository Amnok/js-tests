# Generators

> introduced in es6.
> creating an iterator ourselves isn't difficult but it is verbose.
> generators are a special class of functions that simplify the task of writing iterators.
> A generator is a function that can stop midway and then continue where it stopped. It can actually pause the execution.
> A generator object may only be iterated once.
