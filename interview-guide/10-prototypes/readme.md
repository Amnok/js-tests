# Prototype

> In JS every function has an object called prototype which allows us to share methods across all instances of that function. We can use that property to define all the shareble methods.

> arrow functions don't have an prototype

> On every function prorotype there is a property called constructor which points back to the function itself.

> prototype chain is a way of delegation through all objects to find the key until.

> Object.protype = null.

> Object.create

> Ex:- let person = Object.create(somemethod) // object.create will put smemethod to person prototype
